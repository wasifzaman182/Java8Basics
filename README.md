 # JML 
 
  in the object-oriented setting:
       units to be specified are interfaces, classes, and their methods
        first focus on methods
        methods specified by potentially referring to:
             ▶ result value,
             ▶ initial values of formal parameters,
             ▶ accessible part of pre/post-state

 #  Specifications as Contracts
    To stress the different roles– obligations– and responsibilities in a specification:
     1. widely used analogy of the specification as a contract
     2. contract between caller and callee of method callee guarantees certain outcome provided caller guarantees prerequisites
