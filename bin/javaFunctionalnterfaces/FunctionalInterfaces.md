#@FunctionalInterface
      This annotation is used to indicate that the interface is intended to be a functional interface. The compiler will return a meaningful error if you define an interface using the @FunctionalInterface annotation and it isn’t a functional interface. For example, an error message could be “Multiple non-overriding abstract methods found in interface Foo” to indicate that more than one abstract method is available. Note that the @FunctionalInterface annotation isn’t mandatory, but it’s good practice to use it when an interface is designed for that purpose. You can think of it like the @Override notation to indicate that a method is overridden.
